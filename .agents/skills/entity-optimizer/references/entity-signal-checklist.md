### Signal Category Summary
| Category | Status | Key Findings |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Structured Data | Strong / Gaps / Missing | [findings] |
| Knowledge Base | Strong / Gaps / Missing | [findings] |
| Consistency (NAP+E) | Strong / Gaps / Missing | [findings] |
| Third-Party | Strong / Gaps / Missing | [findings] |
| AI-Specific | Strong / Gaps / Missing | [findings] |

### Top 5 Priority Actions
1. **[Signal]** — [action] | Impact: [H/M] | Effort: [L/M/H]
2-5. [Same format]

### Roadmap
**Week 1-2 (Foundation)**: Schema, sameAs, NAP+E consistency, About page
**Month 1 (Knowledge Bases)**: Wikidata, CrunchBase, directories, Wikipedia notability path
**Month 2-3 (Authority)**: Authoritative mentions, co-citation, topical clusters, PR
**Ongoing (AI)**: Quarterly AI testing, update factual claims, monitor AI output
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Wikidata** — most influential editable KB; often triggers KP creation within weeks
2. **sameAs is your most powerful Schema.org property** — always include Wikidata URL first
3. **Test AI recognition before and after** — query ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google AI Overview
4. **Entity signals compound** — 5 weak signals together > 1 strong signal alone
5. **Consistency beats completeness** — consistent name across 10 platforms > perfect profile on 2
6. **Don't neglect disambiguation** — if name is shared, disambiguation is first priority
